# cuda-mat-mul

## TODOs:
- Catch exceptions for now, log and then in future send error packet.
- Host as a server, recieve packets and respond to packets.
- Create logic to package up the JSON/internal python representation into binary and send to my laptop via TCP.
- Then do the matmul and send back.
